# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to use VBA to represent green stock data for years 2017 and 2018. This project was created for Steve in order to aid him and his parents in looking at yearly data trends, which will allow them to make informative future investments. 

The code in this project has been refactored to run efficiently on more systems, and will allow analysis to run easily through additional stock data. 

## Results 

By refactoring the code, it can be seen in the photos below that the time it takes to run the code significantly dropped with the refactored code when compared to the original:

As we can see from the representation above, the refactored code run in 100th of a second when compared to the original code with run in 10th of seconds. The same conclusion can be made with the 2018 analysis, illustrated below.
